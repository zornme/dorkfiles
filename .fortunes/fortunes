  Anything that cannot be explained in one sentence is based on
  deception and lies.  Like the sentence before this one,
  about explanations.  And this one, about the government.

Registrar: What do you want?
Crawford:  I brought this lady down to register.
Registrar: (after giving the woman a card to fill out and sending her outside in the hall)  Why did you bring this lady down here?
Crawford:  Because she wants to be a first class citizen just like y'all.
Registrar: Who are you to bring people down to register.
Crawford:  It's my job.
Registrar: Suppose you get two bullets in your head right now?
Crawford:  I got to die anyhow.
Registrar: If I don't do it, I can get somebody else to do it. (No reply)
Registrar: Are you scared?
Crawford:  No.
Registrar: Suppose somebody came in that door and shoot you in the back of the head right now.  What would you do?
Crawford:  I couldn't do nothing.  If they shoot me in the back of the head there are people coming from all over the world.
Registrar: What people?
Crawford:  The people I work for.

  When you don't create things, you become defined by your
  tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow &
  exclude people. So create.

  Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless
  swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not
  let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you
  deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature
  of your battle. The world you desired can be won. It exists, it is real, it
  is possible, it is yours.

  And I shambled after them as I have been doing all my life after people who
  interest me, because the only people for me are the mad ones, mad to live,
  mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the
  ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn burn burn like
  fabulous roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars..."

  Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do
  it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.

  One writer I know tells me that he sits down every morning and says to
  himself nicely, "It's not like you don't have a choice, because you
  do—you can either type or kill yourself."

  Don't be afraid of your material or your past.  Be afraid of wasting any
  more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you.  Be afraid of
  not getting your writing done.

  You simply keep putting down one damn word after the other, as your hear
  them, as they come to you.  You can make the work a chore, or you can have
  a good time.  You can do it the way you used to clear the dinner dishes when
  you were thirteen, or you can do it as a Japanese person would perform a tea
  ceremony, with a level of concentration and care in which you can lose
  yourself, and so in which you can find yourself.
